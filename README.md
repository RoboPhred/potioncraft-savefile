Dependencies are placed on the `/externals` folder

## Newtonsoft.JSON

Because Potion Craft is built with a unity configuration that does not support reflection, a unity specific version of Newtonsoft.JSON needs to be used.
The release can be found at https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/releases.
Move `/Plugins/Newtonsoft.JSON AOT/Newtonsoft.JSON.dll` to the externals folder
